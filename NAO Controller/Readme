The added .Jar file should be added to the project structure as a dependency, this should be done in order to
make the NAO functions usable.

We tested this on a NAO robot from Softbank Robotics, other uses have not been tested so far.

In order to use the main class you should have a running MQTT server to be able to receive function messages,
this is normaly done via the app. You should change the credentials to your own MQTT server.
